# React + Node.js File Upload Challenge

This is a short coding challenge to test your React and Node.js skills.  
The goal is to build a simple **file upload application** without using any database.  

## Requirements

1. **Frontend (React)**  
   - Create a form with a file input field.  
   - Allow the user to select a file and upload it to the backend.  
   - Display the uploaded file's name and size on successful upload.  

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express)**  
   - Create a file upload endpoint (`POST /upload`).  
   - Handle multipart form-data using a library like `multer`.  
   - Store the uploaded file in a local folder (e.g., `uploads/`).  
   - Send a JSON response with file details (name and size).  

3. **General**  
   - No database is required.  
   - Keep the code clean, modular, and runnable with basic commands.  
   - Ensure the project can be set up and tested quickly.

## Bonus (Optional, not mandatory)

- Add basic error handling (e.g., when no file is selected).  
- Display an image preview if the uploaded file is an image.  

## Submission

1. Push the code to your GitHub repository.  
2. Include clear instructions in the README on how to run both frontend and backend.  
3. Share the repo link once youâ€™re done.
